Simple algorithm that finds points and lines that are close to each other

This alorithm could be improved for instance by using shapes or projections, 
but I like it this way since it do not relies on too many libraries and it is 
simple touderstand. Due to its simplifications it might miss some points that 
were actually within distance to the link. However these occations are few and
only happen to points that fall outside the circles drawn inside the while loop


Projection could be implemented by using:
